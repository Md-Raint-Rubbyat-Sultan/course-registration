# Crouse-Registration

# Project features
1. In this project we implement toast to setting any kind of warning about adding course into cart.
2. We use complex grid layout instead of flex while making course cards and cart section.
3. The code of cart is deigned complicatedly and also comment make it readable and understandable.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

# State management into my assignment
- To be honest about this project most of the time we have to use prop drilling method to handel the states.
- Specially if you look at Course component you can see the props are coming from App.jsx file.
- But most difficult part about prop is to handel cart and toast component. Each of them is taking 3 & 2 props respectively. It was tough to manage the state with that.
